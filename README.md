### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned that I cannot rely entirely on variables to find a solution. In some cases, numeric formulas can enhance percision and reliability.
2. I learned that it is ok, and encouraged, to check the output of the code against a working tax bracket calculator. Previously, I would have been worried that this would qualify as cheating, but am relieved to know that I can utilize external tools to check my output. 
3. I learned that, when writing code based on information that has the ability to change, it is imperitive to check and double check current events/surveys/listings. I need to check and double check the formulas that I am using. If I hadn't checked the 2017 IRS tax bracket numbers, I would not have realized that the "filing single" example code was out of date and needed to be updated according to the website.
